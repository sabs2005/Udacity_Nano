Task0: 
 file reading O(n)+O(n)=O(n)
 get both records O(1)+O(1)
 Final Big O notation: O(n)

Task1:
 file reading O(n)+O(n)=O(n)
 iterating through texts:
  first for loop: O(n)*nested for loop: O(2)*if condition: O(n)*append: O(1)=O(n^2)
 iterating through calls:
  first for loop: O(n)*nested for loop: O(2)*if condition: O(n)*append: O(1)=O(n^2)
 total=O(n)+O(n^2)
 Final Big O notation: O(n^2)

Task2: 
 file reading O(n)
 for loop for calls: O(n)*nested for: O(2)*nested if:get item or append to dict: O(n)=O(n^2)
 for loop for dict: O(n)
 total=O(n)+O(n^2)+O(n)
 Final Big O notation: O(n^2)

Task3:
 file reading O(n)
 for loop for calls: O(n)*nested ifs:O(1)*last nested if(if prefix not in b_nums):O(n)=O(n^2)
 sort: O(nlog(n))
 total= (n)+O(n^2)+O(nlog(n))
 Final Big O notation: O(n^2)

Task4: 
 file reading O(n)
 for loop for calls: O(n)*O(2)=O(n)
 for loop for callr_list: O(n)*nested if: O(n)+O(n))*O(1)=O(n): O(n^2)
 sort: O(n(log(n))
 total= O(n)+O(n^2)+O(nlog(n))
 Final Big O notation: O(n^2)
